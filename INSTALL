Building Metlibs and Diana 
--------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------

On a clean stock Ubuntu Hardy install, you will first need to install build tools:

    * build-essentials
    * gfortran
    * autoconf
    * automake
    * libtool
    * subversion

Next, you will need to install various third-party libraries that Metlibs and Diana depend on:

    * flex
    * bison
    * ftgl-dev
    * libtiff4-dev
    * libqt4-dev
    * libqt4-opengl-dev
    * libproj-dev
    * libboost-dev (*)
    * libboost-date-time-dev
    * libboost-serialization-dev
    * libboost-thread-dev
    * liblog4cpp5-dev
    * libcurl4-gnutls-dev
    * libshp-dev
    * libavformat-dev (*)
    * libxt-dev
    * libfimex-dev (*)

For HDF5 support in Metlibs and Diana
    *
      libhdf5-serial-dev (XXX actually optional)


For bufr observation support in Diana:

    * EMOSLIB (no package; install manually from 
      http://www.ecmwf.int/products/data/software/interpolation.html)

For fimex support:
    * https://wiki.met.no/fimex/start


Except for those marked with (*), configure will terminate 
with an error message if any required package is absent.
