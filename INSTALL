Building Metlibs and Diana 
--------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------

On a clean stock Ubuntu Hardy install, you will first need to install build tools:

    * build-essentials
    * gfortran
    * autoconf
    * automake
    * libtool

Next, you will need to install various third-party libraries that Metlibs and Diana depend on:

    * ftgl-dev
    * libtiff4-dev
    * libqt4-dev
    * libqt4-opengl-dev
    * proj
    * libboost-dev (*)
    * libboost-date-time-dev
    * libboost-serialization-dev
    * libboost-thread-dev
    * libmysqlclient15-dev (*)
    
For wdb (database, see wdb.met.no) support in Metlibs and Diana

    * libpqxx-dev (*)

For HDF5 support in Metlibs and Diana
    *
      libhdf5-serial-dev (XXX actually optional)


For observation buffer support in Diana:

    * EMOSLIB (no package; install manually from 
      http://www.ecmwf.int/products/data/software/interpolation.html)

For GRIB support in Metlibs and Diana:

    *GRIB API (no package; install manually from 
     http://www.ecmwf.int/products/data/software/download/grib_api.html)

For NetCDF support in Metlibs and Diana:

    * libnetcdf-dev
    * UDUNITS (no package; install manually from 
    http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/udunits-1/index.html)

For profet support (under development)

    *libomniorb4-dev (XXX actually optional)
    * omniidl4


Except for those marked with (*), configure will terminate 
with an error message if any required package is absent.
