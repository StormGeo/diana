Description: Diana - a meteorological visualisation tool
 Diana is the core visualisation tool from met.no (Norwegian
 Meteorological Institute) and is distributed under the GPL 
 license. See gpl.txt for details concerning the GPL license.
 Diana is a graphical viewer and editor developed for use with
 meteorological and oceanographic data.  It uses OpenGL for the
 graphics and Trolltech Qt for the user interface.
 Diana shows fields, observations and satellite and radar images on a
 map. 2D-trajectories can be computed from wind and ocean current
 fields.  The tool also displays vertical profiles (soundings),
 vertical crossections and wave spectrum data in separate windows, all
 from preprocessed data. Preprocessing software is however not a part
 of Diana.  The editor tools consist of a field editor and a drawing
 tool for fronts, symbols and area types.
